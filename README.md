Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

What was your motivation? My motivation was to learn how to create a workable assignment for a client that wanted to have something to showcase their company.
Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I wanted to learn how to create something that can be used not only to help a client but help any project that I may want to do.
What problem does it solve? This solves the problem of how using the CSS and the HTML by actually creating the structure for each part of the CSS and HTML and makes it easier for me to create a web design for personal use.
What did you learn? I learned that CSS stylesheet can provide more helpful and compliment in creating a web design by designing a title all the way to the footer allows the content to be designed in a way that can give an appearance that can be appealing to a client for future work and make it easier for people to want to look and explore what has been created.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax: md ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.
üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges
badmath Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
